This project was structured as Mono-Repository and was bootstrapped with [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v12)

- [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html)
- [aws-sam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html)

## Available scripts

This project provides the following scripts:

```bash
npm install
```

Installs all devDependencies. Once finished, all other scripts in the `package.json` are available to you.

```bash
npm run compile
```
Installs all runDependencies in all domains, and then compiles all domains.

```bash
npm run bundler
```

Runs `compile` in all domains via [PRE-hook](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), and then runs [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) to bundle every lambda-function.

---

This project uses [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) and [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest) for tests.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Runs all unit-tests {test-files with `unit`-suffix} in the project.

```bash
npm run test:int
```

Runs all int-tests {test-files with `int`-suffix}   in the project.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Runs all e2e-tests {test-files with `e2e`-suffix}   in the project.

**Tip:**
To run `test:*` for any specific domain, simply switch into its module and run all the same test-scripts there.

---

```bash
npm run tslint
```

Runs [tslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint)     in the project and automatically fixes your prgramming-issues.

```bash
npm run prettier
```

Runs [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) in the project and automatically fixes your formatting-issues.

### [git-hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

This project uses [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) and [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) to run `tslint` and `prettier` on all staged files in a `pre-commit` phase.

### [aws-cdk](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk)

Cloud-deployments/-removals are done with the `aws-cdk`.

#### `npm run deploy:{ENV}`

```bash
npm run deploy:test # Deploys the backend in the test-env.
npm run deploy:prod # ...
```

**Tip:**
For CI/CD append `approval` flag: `npm run deploy:test -- --require-approval never`. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html).

#### `npm run remove:{ENV}`

```bash
npm run remove:test # Removes the backend in the test-env.
npm run remove:prod # ...
```

**Tip:**
For CI/CD append `force` flag: `npm run remove:test -- --force`. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html).

### [aws-sam](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam) and aws-cdk?

For more info how to test locally with `aws-sam` and `aws-cdk` please refer to the following [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html#sam).

```bash
cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml # ---> Depends on 'npm run bundle'
sam local invoke createCustomerFunctionXXXXXXXX --event domains/customer/events/create-event.json
```

Alternatively, you can also run:

```bash
cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml # ---> Depends on 'npm run bundle'
sam local start-api
```

`aws-sam` automatically finds any lambda-functions within your `template.yaml` which have HTTP event-sources defined. Then, it mounts them at the defined HTTP paths.
